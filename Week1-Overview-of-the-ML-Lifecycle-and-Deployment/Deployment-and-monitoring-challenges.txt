2. Data Drift and Concept Drift
    Data Drift:
        When the input distribution (X) changes over time. Example: Changes in lighting conditions affect the accuracy of a model
        detecting scratches on smartphones.
    Concept Drift:
        When the desired output mapping (from X to Y) changes over time. Example: A change in purchasing behavior during the 
        COVID-19 pandemic affects fraud detection models.

3. Examples from Speech Recognition
    Data Sources:
        Purchased/licensed data: Audio and transcripts.
        Historical user data: User interactions with the system.
    Impact of Data Drift:
        If new user data or speech patterns emerge (e.g., new smartphone models with different microphones), the performance 
        of speech recognition models can degrade.
        Continuous data changes can lead to the need for frequent model updates to maintain accuracy.

4. Handling Data Changes
    Dev and Test Sets:
        Evaluate the model on recent data (e.g., the last few months) to ensure it adapts to changes in the data distribution.
    
    Monitoring for Data Drift:
        After deployment, it’s crucial to monitor the system for data changes (e.g., new vocabulary or speech patterns)
        and update the model accordingly.
    
    Gradual vs. Sudden Changes: 
        Gradual Change: Slow evolution of data, like the introduction of new vocabulary in a language.
        Sudden Shock: Rapid changes in data, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic, when consumer behaviors shifted significantly.

5. Terminology:
    Data Drift:
        Changes in the input data distribution (e.g., new trends, new products).
    Concept Drift:
        Changes in the relationship between input and output (e.g., new behaviors that change how the model should interpret data).

6. Impact on Model Performance:
    Data Drift:
        Can lead to the need for retraining the model on new data that reflects the current distribution.
    Concept Drift:
        May require adjustments in the model’s understanding or logic to account for the changing 
        relationship between inputs and outputs.

7. Dealing with Data and Concept Drift:
    Regular monitoring and retraining are key to maintaining model accuracy over time.
    Understanding whether the changes are gradual or sudden will help decide whether frequent updates are needed.
    By recognizing and addressing data drift and concept drift, you can ensure that your deployed machine learning models
    continue to perform well even as real-world conditions change.
