1. Scoping:
    a. Define the project goal (what to apply ML to).
    b. Identify X (features) and Y (target variable).

2. Data Collection:
    a. Acquire relevant data.
    b. Define and organize data, ensuring it's properly labeled.
    c. Establish a baseline for performance.

3. Model Training:
    a. Select and train the model.
    b. Perform error analysis to identify model weaknesses.
    c. Iteratively update the model or collect more data as needed.

4. Error Analysis & Final Check:
    a. Conduct error analysis to ensure model performance is sufficient.
    b. Perform a final audit before deployment.

5. Deployment:
    a. Deploy the model in production.
    b. Write necessary software for production deployment.
    c. Monitor live traffic and track system performance.

6. Maintenance & Iteration:
    a. Monitor for data distribution changes, retrain or update the model if needed.
    b. Use live data feedback for continuous improvement (error analysis, data updates, model retraining).
    c. Cycle between deployment, monitoring, and maintenance to refine the system.
