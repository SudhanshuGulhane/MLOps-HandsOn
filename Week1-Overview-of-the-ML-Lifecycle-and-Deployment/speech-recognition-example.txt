We can use the machine learning project life cycle to set through a speech recognition example to get a better idea.

1. Scoping:

    a. Define the project: Choose the application (e.g., speech recognition for voice search).
    b. Estimate key metrics:
    c. Accuracy: How accurate is the transcription?
    d. Latency: How long does it take to transcribe speech?
    e. Throughput: How many queries per second can the system handle?
    f. Estimate resources: Time, compute, budget, and timeline for the project.

2. Data Collection:

    a. Define the data: Collect audio data (e.g., speech recordings for voice search).
    b. Establish a baseline: Initial model performance with the collected data.
    c. Label and organize data: Transcribe the speech accurately.
    d. Challenges: Consistency in labeling (e.g., how to transcribe noisy or unclear audio).
        Example: Transcriptions like "Um today's weather" could be written in different ways, leading to inconsistency.
        Standardization of transcription conventions is crucial for model training.

3. Data Definition Questions:

    a. Silence handling: How much silence to include before/after the speech (e.g., 100ms, 300ms, 500ms)?
    b. Volume normalization: How to handle different loudness levels within the same audio clip?

4. Model Training:

    a. Select and train the model: Based on labeled data, choose an appropriate model for speech recognition.
    b. Error analysis: Evaluate and improve the model's transcription accuracy by identifying weaknesses.
    c. Iterative process: Refining the model based on performance feedback and data inconsistencies.

5. Deployment:

    a. Deploy in production: Implement the trained speech recognition model in a live system.
    b. Monitor and maintain: Track performance, handle new speech patterns, and update the model when needed.

5. Maintenance & Iteration:

    Continuous feedback loop: Use real-world data to identify new challenges, retrain the model, and improve performance over time.

The key challenge in speech recognition systems is managing data consistency and ensuring that labeling standards are followed across 
all collected audio clips. This helps ensure that the model learns effectively from the data.
