# Machine Learning in Production: Notes and Projects

Welcome to my repository for the **Machine Learning in Production** course on Coursera! This repository contains my personal notes, code, and lab projects as I progress through the course. The goal is to build a strong foundation in designing, deploying, and maintaining machine learning systems in production.

## About the Course

This course focuses on the complete lifecycle of production ML systems, addressing challenges like concept drift, model evaluation, deployment strategies, and error analysis. It combines the core principles of machine learning with modern software engineering best practices to ensure robust, real-world implementations.
